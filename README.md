# Rule-Based-Classification
![Açıklama](Rule-Based.png)
**Business Problem:**
A gaming company wants to create new customer profiles (personas) based on certain characteristics of its customers and form segments according to these new customer profiles. The company aims to predict how much revenue new customers in these segments could potentially bring to the company on average.

**For example:** 
The company wants to determine the average revenue that a 33 year old female user from Turkey who uses Android can generate.

**Dataset Details:**
The persona.csv dataset contains information on the prices of products sold by an international gaming company and some demographic details of the users who purchased these products. The dataset consists of records generated from each sales transaction. This means that the table is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics might have made multiple purchases.

**The variables in the dataset are:**

* **Price:** Customer spending amount
* **Source:** Type of device the customer is connected from
* **Sex:** Gender of the customer
* **Country:** Country of the customer
* **Age:** Age of the customer

**Project Purpose and Outcome:**
In this case, we analyze our dataset and create rule-based segments for our customers. These segments will guide us in making decisions or  steps  to them.
